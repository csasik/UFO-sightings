# UFO-sightings

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 
All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.


Created a basic HTML web page to list all the extra-terrestrial sightings using  JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js

The UFO dataset is provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. The code appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

You can filter the UFO sightings  based on date/time, city, state, country and shape.
